###Pre-requisites

####Common tools

All our .NET developments use a standard toolset which are [detailed in the main documentation site](/nettoolset/ "View details on the standard .NET toolset").

####WSUS Smart Approve Specific

#####WSUS
In order to build the project you will need to have at least the [client part of WSUS installed](wsusclient/ "Details on installing the client part of WSUS").

###Get the source code

####Create a ticket (if you intend to submit a contribution)</h2>
If you have an idea for a contribution, please create a ticket for it on Codeplex. This helps know of ideas, and may spur on other ideas or aid us in giving you information in regards to your idea.

####Working with the right branch
The development branch can be highly volatile, and isn't guaranteed to build, but it would be the branch to choose.  Even if it doesn't build it can be worth viewing to see if any major changes are being made that could hamper integration of your contribution if you work on another branch. The test branch is more stable but may depending on your timing be a pre-release. The release branch matches releases on Codeplex, it would be recommended not to do any work on this branch.

####Submitting a contribution
TODO: This will be updated as source control hosting is being reviewed.
